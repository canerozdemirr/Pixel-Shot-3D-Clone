# Pixel-Shot-3D-Clone
A clone of the Pixel Shot 3D game that was published by Rollic Games

The game lacks a trajectory prediction line at the moment. It is because of the third party asset that I used. This causes a weird bug when I implemented multi-physics scene with those assets. I wasn't able to solve this so I need to drop it at this moment. I am planning to fix that later and update this repository with a trajectory line.
